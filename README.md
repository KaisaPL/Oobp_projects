Object oriented browser programming -course projects.
1. Text based game
2. Online store

Text based game is written in Javascript by using object oriented programming. The game was supposed to be created so, that it is easy to modify and expand.
The idea of the game is to move around several rooms in a dungeon, kill enemies and find a portal to win the game.
Game can be run with node.js and Visual Studio Code terminal.

The online store -project is made by HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The idea of this project was learn how to implement JS code into HTML and make a basic online store. The products should be on a separate .json file
The requirements for this were that there are 10 products and each of them can be opened to see a product information page. It should be possible to add and remove products from the shopping cart.
