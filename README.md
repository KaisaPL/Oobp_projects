Object oriented browser programming -course projects:
1. Text based game
2. Online store

The text based game is a simple game made by Javascript by using object oriented programming. The game is made so that it is easy to modify and expand.
The idea of the game is to explore a dungeon, fight monsters and find a portal to win the game.
This can be run by Node.js and VSCode terminal.

The online store is a prototype of an actual online store made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The store includes 10 products, which all have an information page
and which can be added and removed to/from the shopping cart.
The idea of this website was to learn how to implement JS code in HTML so that it is possible to get an interactive website.
